# Graphathon Code Snippets

A set of code snippets to help you get started with Neo4j at the Graphathon. This repository provides practical examples of how to:

1. Connect to and work with Neo4j databases
2. Load data from external sources like BigQuery
3. Create graph structures with nodes and relationships
4. Visualize graph data using modern tools

## Repository Structure

- `examples` - Code examples for typical activities
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks with interactive examples
- `pyproject.toml` - Project dependencies and configuration

## Purpose

These examples are designed to be generic starting points that you can adapt for your Graphathon projects. The specific implementation details are less important than understanding the patterns and techniques demonstrated.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Neo4j database (local, cloud, or Docker)
- Google Cloud access (for BigQuery examples)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for local Neo4j setup)

## For Graphathon Participants

These code snippets provide foundational patterns for:
- Connecting to Neo4j databases
- Loading data from various sources
- Creating graph structures
- Visualizing results
- Creating MCP servers and tools

Use these examples as starting points and modify them for your specific Graphathon use case. The goal is to help you get up and running quickly with Neo4j!
