    "### What are embeddings?\n",
    "- Embeddings are coordinates assigned to objects in a made up digital space ('vector space'). They are usually -- but not always -- used to identify the similarities of objects to one another. For our purposes, 'Embedding' and 'Vector' mean the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why would I do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence Embeddings:** You want to know which sentences in a corpus of texts are the most similar. If you embed the semantic meaning of the sentences, you can extract clusters of similar sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Node Embeddings** You have a bunch of nodes (Users) in a graph database which exhibit certain behaviours. If you embed those nodes for similarity, you can cluster users by behavioural characteristics.\n",

    "- Gives each of your nodes a coordinate position, based on how similar each node is to every other node. It assesses where each node would live within a pre-computed space.\n",
    "- In GDS you have the added option of using properties as weights when calculating FastRP embeddings.\n",

    "**Why use it:** \n",
    "- Fast RP can be great addition to a recommendations application. For example, with our graph you could grab the top-10 (topK 10) nearest Movie nodes to each user node, filter by those already seen by the user, and then provide the remainder as recommendations.\n",
    "- You may find that using Community Detection and FastRP together, you find user-specific recommendations that you would not otherwise have found. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Consider this scenario:**\n",
    "A user tends to watch high-octane action movies along with the odd horror. If we built a recommendation engine based solely on their favourite movies, we would miss other behavioural quirks. For example, every other month -- without fail -- this user also watches three romantic-comedies in sequence. \n",
    "Their genre profile ignores the romantic-comedy. Their Leiden community with FastRP backup, however, might move them into a group of users who demonstrate similar watching behaviours. Their user group can now receive recommendations for action, horror and romantic-comedies. Those particular recommendations won't be generic either. They will be based on the behaviours of other people displaying similar behaviours to our user.\n",

    "**But...** In practice, dense nodes in a network can have a strong gravitational effect. So, if you based a recommendation engine on Fast RP embeddings alone, you would likely end up with one super node dominating all recommendations. As with Leiden, this is not necessarily a bad thing -- it just depends on your intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Let's say you are a massive movie platform, and you want X-number of users to see Y-movie for Z-business-reason. Your intent then is not 'recommend movies people will like'. It is 'recommend movies we need users to watch to users who may be most partial'. If that is the case, you could run FastRP on all nodes, and then find the users who are most similar to that movie. If you need 1000 users to watch it to hit a KPI, just increase topK to find the users who are likely to be more partial to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Contrast:** Let's say you are a boutique arthouse platform with a large, diverse offering of lesser-known titles. You want to ensure that users can easily find titles they are most likely to enjoy. In this case, you might:\n",
    "- Run Community Detection (Leiden or Louvain) to identify distinct clusters of users.\n",
    "- Run FastRP\n",
    "- Filter allowable recommendations by ensuring that the users' communityIds match the movies' communityIds. In this way, you can go super granular, and get the best movie within a cluster of people, rather than for the entire set.\n",
