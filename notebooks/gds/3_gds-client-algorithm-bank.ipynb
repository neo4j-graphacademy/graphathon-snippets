    "Label propagation does the following:\n",
    "- Provides a unique id _('label')_ to every node in the graph\n",
    "- Iteratively 'propagates' each node's labels to its neighbours\n",
    "- At each iteration, the labels are counted for each node. Whichever label dominates a section becomes the winning label for that cluster and the others are discarded.\n",
    "- Iterations continue until each node has the majority label of its neighbours or when we reach a maximum number of user-defined iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why would I use this?**\n",
    "- Label Propagation is faster and less memory intensive than Louvain or Leiden.\n",
    "- If your network updates frequently, label propagation can be used to update communities within frequently updated networks -- social media, for example.\n",
    "- If you have already identified some extant communities, LP allows you to pre-label them and have the Label Propagation start from there.\n",

    "### PageRank\n",
    "PageRank is -- or was -- the original algorithm underlying Google search. It measures the importance of each node in a graph relative to the number of incoming relationships it has, and the importance of the nodes providing those relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why would I use it?**\n",
    "While its uses for web search are clear, you could apply PageRank to a bunch of use cases. For instance, you could apply it to our movie graph to find the most influential users by ratings. Let's say 'Marvin' has rated thousands of movies in the graph and most are poorly connected to other movies. 'Tom Bombadil' has only rated six movies. Those six movies that 'Tom Bombadil' has rated happen to be connected to other highly-rated movies throughout the network. In PageRank, we might expect Tom Bombadil to have more weight than Marvin.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, PageRank cares more about the quality of connections and the strength of their interconnectivity than the total number of connections overall. You can use it to identify the most important entity in any network. Other use cases include:\n",
    "- **Fraud detection:** Flag accounts connected to influential known fraudsters.\n",
    "- **Academia:** Identify the most influential researchers or papers in a citation network.\n",
    "- **Social media influence:** Identify the most influential 'influencers' in a social media network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its uses are endless. \n",
